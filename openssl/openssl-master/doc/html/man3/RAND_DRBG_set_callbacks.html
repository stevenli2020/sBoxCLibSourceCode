<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>RAND_DRBG_set_callbacks() sets the callbacks for obtaining fresh entropy and the nonce when reseeding the given <b>drbg</b>. The callback functions are implemented and provided by the caller. Their parameter lists need to match the function prototypes above.</p>

<p>RAND_DRBG_set_callback_data() can be used to store a pointer to some context specific data, which can subsequently be retrieved by the entropy and nonce callbacks using RAND_DRBG_get_callback_data(). The ownership of the context data remains with the caller, i.e., it is the caller&#39;s responsibility to keep it available as long as it is needed by the callbacks and free it after use. For more information about the callback data see the NOTES section.</p>

<p>Setting the callbacks or the callback data is allowed only if the DRBG has not been initialized yet. Otherwise, the operation will fail. To change the settings for one of the three shared DRBGs it is necessary to call RAND_DRBG_uninstantiate() first.</p>

<p>The <b>get_entropy</b>() callback is called by the <b>drbg</b> when it requests fresh random input. It is expected that the callback allocates and fills a random buffer of size <b>min_len</b> &lt;= size &lt;= <b>max_len</b> (in bytes) which contains at least <b>entropy</b> bits of randomness. The <b>prediction_resistance</b> flag indicates whether the reseeding was triggered by a prediction resistance request.</p>

<p>The buffer&#39;s address is to be returned in *<b>pout</b> and the number of collected randomness bytes as return value.</p>

<p>If the callback fails to acquire at least <b>entropy</b> bits of randomness, it must indicate an error by returning a buffer length of 0.</p>

<p>If <b>prediction_resistance</b> was requested and the random source of the DRBG does not satisfy the conditions requested by [NIST SP 800-90C], then it must also indicate an error by returning a buffer length of 0. See NOTES section for more details.</p>

<p>The <b>cleanup_entropy</b>() callback is called from the <b>drbg</b> to clear and free the buffer allocated previously by get_entropy(). The values <b>out</b> and <b>outlen</b> are the random buffer&#39;s address and length, as returned by the get_entropy() callback.</p>

<p>The <b>get_nonce</b>() and <b>cleanup_nonce</b>() callbacks are used to obtain a nonce and free it again. A nonce is only required for instantiation (not for reseeding) and only in the case where the DRBG uses a derivation function. The callbacks are analogous to get_entropy() and cleanup_entropy(), except for the missing prediction_resistance flag.</p>

<p>If the derivation function is disabled, then no nonce is used for instantiation, and the <b>get_nonce</b>() and <b>cleanup_nonce</b>() callbacks can be omitted by setting them to NULL.</p>

<h1 id="RETURN-VALUES">RETURN VALUES</h1>

<p>RAND_DRBG_set_callbacks() returns 1 on success, and 0 on failure.</p>

<p>RAND_DRBG_set_callback_data() returns 1 on success, and 0 on failure.</p>

<p>RAND_DRBG_get_callback_data() returns the pointer to the callback data, which is NULL if none has been set previously.</p>

<h1 id="NOTES">NOTES</h1>

<p>It is important that <b>cleanup_entropy</b>() and <b>cleanup_nonce</b>() clear the buffer contents safely before freeing it, in order not to leave sensitive information about the DRBG&#39;s state in memory.</p>

<p>A request for prediction resistance can only be satisfied by pulling fresh entropy from a live entropy source (section 5.5.2 of [NIST SP 800-90C]). It is up to the user to ensure that a live entropy source is configured and is being used.</p>

<p>The derivation function is disabled by calling the RAND_DRBG_new_ex() function with the RAND_DRBG_FLAG_CTR_NO_DF flag. For more information on the derivation function and when it can be omitted, see [NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1]. Roughly speaking it can be omitted if the random source has &quot;full entropy&quot;, that is, it contains 8 bits of entropy per byte. In a FIPS context, the derivation function can never be omitted.</p>

<p>Even if a nonce is required, the <b>get_nonce</b>() and <b>cleanup_nonce</b>() callbacks can be omitted by setting them to NULL. In this case the DRBG will automatically request an extra amount of entropy (using the <b>get_entropy</b>() and <b>cleanup_entropy</b>() callbacks) which it will utilize for the nonce, following the recommendations of [NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1], section 8.6.7.</p>

<p>The callback data is a rather specialized feature, because in general the random sources don&#39;t (and in fact, they must not) depend on any state provided by the DRBG. There are however exceptional cases where this feature is useful, most notably for implementing known answer tests (KATs) or deterministic signatures like those specified in RFC6979, which require passing a specified entropy and nonce for instantiating the DRBG.</p>
